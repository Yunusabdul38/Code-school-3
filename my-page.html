    <h3><u>About myself</u></h3>
    <p>
      My name is Abdulrahman Barrkindo Bin-Uthman, based in Kaduna, Chikun Local
      Government Area. I am a graduate of Kaduna Polytechnic, where I studied
      Science Laboratory Technology (SLT) with specialization in Chemistry and
      Biochemistry. Alongside my academic background in science, I have
      developed a strong interest in Frontend Development, driven by my passion
      for technology, design, and problem-solving. Outside of academics and
      tech, I enjoy good food — especially jollof rice with grilled chicken —
      and I like spending my free time exploring coding projects, reading, and
      football as my hobbies. My blend of science, technology, and creativity
      inspires me to keep learning and building solutions that make an impact

    <h3>Fun Facts About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I studied SLT Chemistry and Biochemistry, but instead of mixing chemicals
      in the lab, I now mix colors and codes on the computer. Less explosions,
      more websites!

    <p>
      My favorite food is jollof rice with grilled chicken. If you ever lose me,
      just follow the smell of good food — I’ll probably be there already.

    <p>
      I love reading and playing football. Basically, I score goals on the field
      and also in my code (well… most of the time).
